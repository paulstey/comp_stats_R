comp_stats_R
============

This repository will house R code for some programming exercises in a class on Computational Statistics. When I was taking this class, I often thought stumbling upon a repo like this would have been helpful. The work here is largely my own, but obviously I benefitted greatly from the instructor as well as fellow students. I shall not name these for fear that any of my potential errors might sully their reputations, but they know who they are and that I'm grateful for their help.
